# DBXen Access List Creation Tool

## Overview
THIS CODE IS STILL BEING TESTED. TEST AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

The DBXen Access List Creation Tool is designed to help users burn XEN tokens more efficiently by leveraging access lists. This tool empowers everyone to burn XEN by creating access lists, making the process accessible and leveling the playing field in the XEN ecosystem.

## Features
- Approve XEN tokens for burning
- Create access lists by burning a batch of XEN tokens
- Burn multiple batches using saved access lists to reduce gas fees
- Recalculate protocol fees dynamically based on the updated gas fees
- User-friendly interface with color-coded outputs

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `web3` library
- `dotenv` library
- `colorama` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DBXen-Access-List-Creation-Tool.git
    cd DBXen-Access-List-Creation-Tool
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install web3 python-dotenv colorama
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:
    ```env
    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
    PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
    RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python dxn-al.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to:
    - Set the max gas price
    - Check if an access list exists
    - Approve XEN tokens
    - Burn 1 batch to create an access list
    - Burn batches using the access list
    - Tip the creator

## Example

Upon running the script, you will see a menu with options to perform different actions. Here’s an example of what the menu looks like:
